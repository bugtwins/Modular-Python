# Modular-Python - (under-development)

Planned Features :
  1. Visual Python - Minimum use of text, inter-connected nodes represent the code logic
  2. Ability to translate visual code logic into python script
  3. Nodes - Each node is a tkinter Frame widget functioning as a separating python program
             Input can be fed through output of other node and vice-e-versa
             Nodes may also contain python code inside textarea
  4. Ability to create custom nodes as per requirement of the user - Eg. Node displaying matplotlib plots

  5. Each node can be configured to run on seprate thread
